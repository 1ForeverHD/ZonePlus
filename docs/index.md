## Summary

ZonePlus is a module enabling the construction of dynamic zones. These zones utilise region checking, raycasting and the new [BasePart.CanTouch] property to effectively determine players and parts within their boundaries.

Creating a zone is as simple as:

``` lua
-- Assuming we place ZonePlus in ReplicatedStorage
local Zone = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Zone)
local zoneGroup = workspace.SafeZoneGroup
local zone = Zone.new(zoneGroup)
```

Zones take one argument: a **group**. A group can be any non-basepart instance (such as a Model, Folder, etc) that contain descendant [baseparts]. Alternatively a group can be a singular basepart instance, or a table containing an array of baseparts. 

!!! info
    Zones are compatible with all basepart classes, however it's recommended to use simple parts (blocks, balls, cylinders, wedges, etc) where possible as these are more efficient and accurate. Some classes for instance, such as MeshParts and UnionOperations, require additional raycast checks to verify their surface geometries.

These group parts are then used to define the region and precise bounds of the zone.

!!! info
    Zones are dynamic. This means if a group part changes size or position, or if a basepart is added to or removed from the zone group, then an internal ``_update()`` method will be called to recalculate its bounds.

Once constructed, you can utilise zone events to determine players, parts and the localplayer *entering* or *exiting* a zone. For instance, to listen for a *player* entering and exiting a zone, do:

```lua
zone.playerEntered:Connect(function(player)
    print(("%s entered the zone!"):format(player.Name))
end)

zone.playerExited:Connect(function(player)
    print(("%s exited the zone!"):format(player.Name))
end)
```

!!! info
    On the client you may only wish to listen for the LocalPlayer (such as for an ambient system). To achieve this you would alternatively use the ``.localPlayer`` events.

!!! important
    Zone group parts must remain within the workspace for zones to fully work

If you don't intend to frequently check for items entering and exiting a zone, you can utilise zone methods:

```lua
local playersArray = zone:getPlayers()
```

## Optimisations
Zones by default perform up to 10 checks per second around a *whole* players character. This behaviour can be changed by modifying the **Accuracy** and **Detection** of zones:

### Accuracy
This determines the *frequency* of checks per second.

The accuracy of a zone can be changed two ways with a corresponding [Accuracy Enum]:

1. Using the ``zone:setAccuracy(itemName)`` method:
    ```lua
    zone:setAccuracy("High")
    ```

2. Setting the ``zone.accuracy`` property:
    ```lua
    zone.accuracy = Zone.enum.Accuracy.High
    ```

By default accuracy is ``High``.

!!! info
    Modifying the accuracy of one zone may impact the accuracy of another due to the modules collaborative nature.


### Detection
This determines the *precision* of checks.

The way a zone detects players and parts can be changed two ways with a corresponding [Detection Enum]:

1. Using the ``zone:setDetection(itemName)`` method:
    ```lua
    zone:setDetection("Automatic")
    ```

2. Setting the ``zone.enterDetection`` and ``zone.exitDetection`` properties:
    ```lua
    zone.enterDetection = Zone.enum.Detection.Automatic
    zone.exitDetection = Zone.enum.Detection.Automatic
    ```

By default enterDetection and exitDetection are ``Automatic``.

!!! info
    Modifying the detection of one zone may impact the detection of another due to the modules collaborative nature.

!!! warning
    Setting ``enterDetection`` to (``Zone.enum.Detection.WholeBody`` or ``Zone.enum.Detection.Automatic``) and ``exitDetection`` to ``Zone.enum.Detection.Centre`` will cause the entered and exit events to trigger rapidly when the player lies on the bounds of the zone.
